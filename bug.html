<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 ...">
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient functionality, but the gradient might not render correctly if the `...` contains conflicting or missing styles that interfere with the gradient's rendering.  This can happen if other styles unintentionally override the gradient or if necessary properties are absent.
