```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 w-64 h-32">
</div>
```
This corrected code includes explicit width and height to ensure the gradient is clearly visible.  The gradient direction, starting and ending colors are also correctly specified.  Review other styles applied to the element to ensure no conflicts exist.
